My name is Girish (alias: @gk2savage)
I'm a Cybersecurity Enthusiast and Certified Junior Penetration tester (eJPT).

As a kid, I loved playing with Computers and Networks and wanted to know how 
they actually work. As of now, I want to dive in Cybersecurity and right now 
I am playing CTF's, reverse enginnering binaries, exploiting web applications 
and learning Penetration Testing techniques and methodology. 

I am also a visual artist and worked on learning graphic design for quite some time. 
I really love designing cinematic artworks and add creative touch to everything i do. 
I even produce music and I continue to pursue this as my hobby. 
This page will be dedicated to Cybersecurity and will include walkthroughs 
of Vulnhub and HackTheBox Machines, CTF challenges, my projects, notes, cheatsheets 
and even my thoughts on how the world is going to be revolutionised by cybersecurity.
